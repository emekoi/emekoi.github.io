# About Me
I am Emeka Nkurumeh, a fourth-year undergraduate student at Caltech. My main interests lie in functional programming and systems programming, which means I spend most of my time thinking about compilers. Right now I'm most interested in the compilation of algebraic effect-based systems.

You can find my resume [here](/static/resume.pdf).
